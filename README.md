### Using the Source Code
1. Create a copy of this repository:
    - If [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) is installed, type the following command on the terminal:

      ```
      git clone https://github.com/kahlaoui-amine/Devinette
      ```

    - If git is not installed, click the green <code>Code</code> button near the top right of the repository and choose [<code>Download ZIP</code>](https://github.com/kahlaoui-amine/Poozel/archive/refs/heads/master.zip). Once the zipped folder has been downloaded, extract its contents.

2. Run the app using [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) (or any IDE that supports Android development). Alternatively, Android also provides a <a href = "https://developer.android.com/studio/build/building-cmdline">guide</a> on how to build the app from the command line.
